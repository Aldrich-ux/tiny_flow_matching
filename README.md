# tiny_flow_matching
Tiny Flow-Matching show how to match A distribution to B distribution. Distribution is actually a Dataset, it can be a set of point or a set of image. 

## Dataset
Go to `dataset/synthetic_dataset.py` to generate synthetic checkerboard dataset / distribution. 

## Visulize
See samples from checkboard distribution and gaussian distribution in `test/visual_data.ipynb`, 
enough points could draw outshapes of different distributions.
